# Readme

Project hosting code and tools for the AI&S project (lead: Jenny Williams) studying writers and their use of AI tools.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Visual Studio Code
- Jupyter (VS Code) extensions
- Poetry (dependency / virtual environment manager) https://python-poetry.org/

## Setting things up

Once you have installed poetry, you should install the python dependencies with:

```bash
poetry install
```

After, that you should in theory be ready to use and run the code in the notebook.


## Working with the notebook

Use the notebook after you have annotated a transcription document. To annotate a transcription, you will use MS Word, where you will add comments and highlights to the text. After you save the document, you can use the notebook to generate a markdown table that you can then import where you need it.

The sandbox.ipynb notebook helps extract codes from an annotated .docx transcript. Open it in VS Code (with Jupyter extension), configure any file paths, then run cells top to bottom.
