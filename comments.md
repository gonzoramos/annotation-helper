| me extra sensitive to knowing that ChatGPT was trained on that | Appropriation by AI |
| I work at a school. I'm a librarian | Writing as non primary job |
| I think teaching is definitely creative work too | Human agency - purpose |
| EdTech places to really incorporate [AI] in a way that doesn't feel right to me. | Force adoption |
| my day job influences definitely impact my feelings on [AI] as well. | First-hand experience / exposure to AI adoption |
| I have a random conversation with someone that makes my brain start going. | Creativity methods |
| what if | Creativity methods |
| I write about a 5 to 10 page chapter by chapter | Writing method / process |
| I have a plan and that has been helpful to me with having two children and working full time. | Writing / creative process |
| My first draft is the voice and the vibes and what happens | Writing method / process |
| Then I send it to other writing friends who give me feedback, | Writing / creative process |
| Then I send it to other writing friends who give me feedback, | Writing / motivation - rewards |
| The nice thing about not writing for money is that I can pretty much write what I want. | Writing not main job |
| I don't know what my process would look like if I was writing full time. It probably would be very different, but that's how it works for now | From main job to 2ndary |
| I've been in Google Drive | tools |
| And I do paper and pen throughout | tools |
| But for generative thoughts or making a new outline, that's pen and paper work | Tools, methods |
| are predicting what it thinks I want it to write. | Mental model |
| I'm always going to get an answer from generative AI | Mental model |
| There is no end of the Internet for generative AI | Mental model |
| that doesn't mean that it's giving me the right answer | Mental model |
| I think people are using it as a replacement in a way that makes me really uneasy. | forecasting |
| I think writers who are using it, I don't actually consider them writers. | judging people |
| And it was just dreck. It was absolutely dreadful writing. | Judging ai |
| No. I definitely wanted to see its capabilities; saw them; and moved on. | Judging ai |
| I would say the environmental concerns are one part | Reject reasons |
| the removal of critical thinking from people is another part. | Reject reasons |
| Llama, being trained on the Libgen database or ChatGPT being trained on the New York Times | Reject reasons |
| Llama, being trained on the Libgen database or ChatGPT being trained on the New York Times | Opinion sources |
| It's just been kind of building | Perception forming process |
| I'm on Bluesky. I get a lot of my articles about AI use mainly in education | Opinion sources |
| So I read a lot of articles | Opinion process |
| people send me articles | Opinion process, networking |
| I've become that person that people send the articles to. | Literacy process |
| I do read some scholarly journals, but it's mostly news | Opinion sources |
| Almost everyone who had published a book, their book was there | Opinion reasons |
| We did it without this and realised that even if your end goal is to see your book in a bookstore, if you don't love the process, you're just fucked | Process is the point |
| they love writing and wanna connect with other human beings through their writing. | Writing goals |
| I would eventually feel like I had cheated | Rejection reasons |
| I just don't see how I could use it and then feel like the product that came out of it was something that I created. | Ownership definition |
| Of course, anything that makes their lives easier, they're extremely over scheduled. All of those reasons. That's why they're turning to [AI]. And the desperation | Adoption rationale |
| It's split amongst the faculty. It's split amongst the students | Ai adoption on others |
| I really don't, not generative | Rejection reasons |
| But for my own writing work, I really have a pretty strong line in the sand that I will not see it as my own work anymore, and because I am a very stubborn independent person, it's really important to me that my work is fully my own | Ownership, rejection reasons |
| there's probably a gap between people who've been working for a long time and are published and established, and how they feel about it, and people who are dipping their toe in and see it as an opportunity or like a levelling of the playing field | Expertise as an influence |
| Every person--and I have a decent amount of people that I speak to who are published authors--it's a strong, strong, even more curse words than I dropped, “No” from that cohort of people. I think that you're going to find a gap there, that's my guess | Rejection vs adoption, expert vs novice |
| it's worth all of the struggle that goes into | What is writing, effort is the point |
| taste gap | The taste gap: from Ira Glass |
| the beauty of having gone through that struggle | Rejection reason: Effort is the point |
