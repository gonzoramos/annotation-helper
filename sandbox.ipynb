      "''start from an interesting idea'', process: inspiration\n",
      "''I try to do is spin that idea out. A character suggests themself or a scenario, a situation, and that builds outward'', process: drafting\n",
      "''The novel's been hard, because I haven't felt it follow quite as straightforwardly as I feel like the short fiction sometimes does'', process: frictions\n",
      "''It tends to take place largely within the confines of a document, like a Google doc or a Word document'', process: tools\n",
      "''I try to keep most of it contained in a single document space'', process: structure?\n",
      "''I'm often taking notes by hand when I'm stuck. Lately I've been planning scenes in a physical notebook--using all those prompts to figure out what could happen with this novel'', process: tools\n",
      "''I've tried Scrivener and different things like that. Sometimes if [the novel is] really unwieldy, I'll bounce it out to one of those programs that can let me plan it out better'', process: tools\n",
      "''. I've never successfully written a novel'', context: short stories\n",
      "''There’s something useful to me about having the whole thing at one place, even if that thing is pretty big.'', process: drafting, resource management\n",
      "''I've learned how bad I am at keeping track of things—that's been the main change—so consolidating as much as possible'', process: reflection\n",
      "''It's been narrowing in on trying to have as few tools as possible and stay as focused on the thing'', process: challenges\n",
      "''I haven't brushed up on this in a while, but basically what generative AI does that's unique is it allows for denser and also broader processing of large quantities of data, and a wider range of possible outputs based on that.'', genai: mental model\n",
      "''I know also the predictive thing is an imperfect mapping to what's actually going on, but I tend to think of it in those predictive terms or based on this massive corpus of information, [AI is] able to, in a very sophisticated way, take the averages of what it processes and [produce an] output based on expectations.'', genai: mental model\n",
      "''I tried them especially in the earlier days. You know, you noodle around, your friends are noodling around. [I've worked] on and off [for] that data annotation dot tech website where people train the chat bots basically. I have done that gig for probably 50 hours total or something, so I've worked in that capacity'', genai: experience\n",
      "''You'll be tasked with having a conversation with some chat bot and then it'll be two outputs and you'll rank both outputs'', genai: HFRL\n",
      "''But I don't use it recreationally. I don't ask it questions or anything.'', genai: usage\n",
      "''I will with some of the prompts. It'll be 8 categories of prompt, like closed question, open question, which is whether you provide the thing it's supposed to be getting information from, or whether it's just general purpose. One of them is always creative writing, and so I have asked the AI to write me a Petrarchan sonnet. I've asked it to tell me a story about XYZ. I have engaged with that. It didn't have to do with my writing, but I saw the creative output of it.'', genai: usage\n",
      "''No, I don't think so. Trying to think. [Long pause.] Yeah, I really don't think so'', genai: usage\n",
      "''One of them is the broader ethical concerns'', genai rejection: ethical\n",

      "''The way that companies that are pushing it often have investments in military applications and stuff'', ai harms: military applications/investments\n",
      "''There's the copyright infringement piece. I have complicated feelings about how about fully embracing copyright as the means to getting out of these problems or pushing against this. But I do think that pretty obviously consent should be acquired for people whose materials are being processed by the software or by AI, and it's obvious that that hasn't been secured'', rejection: appropriation without consent\n",
      "''[But] their applications, the way it has entered the public sphere and how much of this is advertising, how much of it constitutes a marketing push, is by and large how I see it most often--and this is also just the circles I run in or whatever—it's framed, I would paraphrase, the overwhelming thing is: “finally we can replace all of these creative people.” That does seem to be one of the ways that it's being pushed'', rejection: replacement of people\n",
      "''I find it personally dispiriting, because [writing] is the one thing that I can do, and it's dispiriting to have that framed as disposable'', rejection: devaluing people\n",
      "''And also, there’s a really impoverished theory of art and what an art object is, and how and what it means to create'', rejection: misalignment about what art/creativity is\n",
      "''I'm uninterested in idea generation, brainstorming, completely uninterested in having something do that for me. I don't think there's anything you could do with the prose itself that I would want it to do. I don't think there's anything on the idea front that I want it to do.'', rejection\n",
      "''It has been pushed into my life, which is another reason why I find it frustrating, right? [I learned that] this button on my computer I bought 6 months ago was actually a Copilot button. Like the way that it comes up on Google. These are all things that feel like impingements.'', rejection: force adoption\n",
      "''I think it's a remarkable technology that is not very good at anything I want it to do. I don't know how I would use it'', genai: mental model\n",
      "''And I also find that there is something very important to me about the faculty of engaging with language, and using it and deploying it. There's something dispiriting to me about the way [AI] offers to [write] even bullshit emails, which I've stressed out about in my life. I don't like that. There's something really unsavoury to me about the way it's tried to push itself into those spheres and automate the human generation of language, which I think is one of the things that makes us the animals that we are'', rejection: forced adoption, dehumanizing\n",
      "''What I engage with here is the aggregate mass of tweets, people making fun of stuff, right?'', genai: sources that impact mental models\n",
      "''So algorithmic curation in general seems to put forth the idea that I already know what I want and what I want is fundamentally similar to what I've liked before. And that's just not how my sensibility operates.'', genai: misalignment of goals\n",
      "''with regards to AI: there's one impoverished idea, which is that art is something which, like, you have this set of desires, and you want to see that played out before you as you imagine it, and then the best way to spend your next 100 minutes would be by seeing that. [But] to me, one of the things about art that's exciting is when it's surprising. And fundamentally, a technology that emerges out of averages and predictions based on extant work is not interesting to me'', rejection: homogenization\n",
      "''If someone handed me a novel [and told me] “I wrote this novel,” and I read it and I was like, it's pretty good. And then they said, “Actually it was written by AI.” It loses interest to me immediately because what is interesting about it is not, \"Here are some words that are connected in a way that is intelligible to me.” That's not necessarily where the pleasure derives. It's far more about, “This is an expression of experience.”'', rejection: lack of shared experience\n",
      "''What was remarkable about that is that nothing funny loses its flair faster to me than generated text'', rejection: ??\n",
      "''And then it was sort of the big pushes in terms of OpenAI PR, etcetera.'', rejection: forced adoption\n",
      "''\"This will replace writers and artists. Now we won't need to worry about these people.” It seemed like that was part of the framing the whole time. I was very turned off by that initially'', rejection: replacement\n",
      "''Phase two, which is I think probably the phase we're in, is the way it's been pushed. It’s extremely off putting, and not [just] in terms of marketing, but it's everywhere, it's ubiquitous, in this unfinished state where it's getting factual errors wrong. I actually did see [Google] get the size of a state wrong'', rejection: forced adoption, broken promises, unfinished product\n",
      "''I did grow up in a window of the Internet--I've always been on the Internet, it's always been part of my life—and it feels as though it is falling apart right now and disgusting in a way that it has not ever been.'', rejection: collapse of the familiar, useful\n",
      "''But my concern is the replacement of jobs and so on.'', rejection: replacement\n",
      "''My exception--the use I found for it is giving me a list of recommendations. It's good at that'', ai benefits: recommendations\n",
      "''One legitimate use I've heard from that space is--[for example], a big online game will have to adapt 500 new pieces of armour to 8000 character models. That kind of grunt work. I'm increasingly like, “Yeah, that's fine.”'', ai benefits: grunt work\n",
      "''I think most fundamentally to me is job replacement. If creative industries can integrate [AI] into their workflows without firing a bunch of people, because now they can just press a button and the art comes out.'', ai harms: job replacement\n",
      "''I've noticed about my peer group'', context: peer group\n",
      "''I feel like I give the technology more grace than a lot of people in creative field. I've noticed [people] not even wanting to think about, feeling so imposed upon by this technology and so disgusted by what it's purporting to do that they don't even want to think about it'', rejection: forced adoption, replacement\n",
      "''People are very concerned about it imitating and being used to imitate writers. One of the things it is capable of doing is pastiche, basically, so people have expressed concern about that'', rejection: replacement, apropriation\n",
      "''I think if it gets really good at OCR, I could scan some notes in. So there's mechanical stuff maybe'', ai benefits: mechanistic tasks, ocr\n",
      "''I already get a text-to-speech [tool] to read manuscripts to me while I'm driving or whatever.'', ai benefits: TTS\n",
      "''I could imagine it organising my schedule'', ai benefits: organization\n",
      "''I don't know anyone who admits to [using AI for creative writing].'', perception of others using genai\n",
      "''So it makes me write less because I don't want to do anything, because it feels like the one skill I have, people are attempting to automate it out of existence'', rejection: fear of replacement\n",
      "''So I would say it's only impacted [me] broadly, abstractly, and negatively.'', ai harms: mental health\n",
      "''I have a few friends who are pretty interested in it, and I talk about it with them a lot in terms of my understanding of the technology.'', genai: sources\n",
      "''The AI specific sources, there was this news curation service called “the syllabus” that curates academic papers, among other things, and collates them into a weekly newsletter. So I was reading the papers that filtered through my purview. I've tried to work my way, usually poorly, through, like, if there are big developments. At this point I read the digital Financial Times and they'll have things about AI sometimes, but not a lot, nothing extensive.'', genai: sources\n",
      "''I would potentially use AI to sort of help see the outline of something I’ve already written. Like I don’t want AI touching the text at all, but I would be intrigued to see a LLM-produced outline of something I’ve already written'', ai benefits: summarization, change representation\n"
